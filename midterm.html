        I decided to create my global issues paper on the topic of social media because, while it is definitely a first world problem, and there are many people that do not have the privilege of accessing the internet, I believe the negative impacts that social media has on the mental health of  all that do use it is still severe enough to be a global epidemic.
The internet is humanity's fastest form of communication, and in today's modern world, we are constantly using social media sites to connect with friends, family, etc. While it has never been easier to keep in contact with people in the age of social media, there have also been rising concerns of social media exacerbating feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and low self esteem. This has been proven throughout all ages of users, but it has had a severe impact on youth, whose minds are still in development and are prone to develop depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and other mental health concerns.
This issue hits close to home with me, because I've experienced first-hand the harmful effects social media can have on your mental health, which is why I've recently decided delete my social media apps and unplug for an indefinite amount of time. I think it's important for young people who are struggling with mental health to distance themselves from social media, because whether we realize it or not, every single piece of content we absorb on a daily basis through these social media apps is influencing us, making us feel like we're lacking in some way, and only worsening feelings of inadequacy and low self esteem.
In this poster, I hope to communicate that by unplugging from social media, we can stop it from subconsciously feeding us negativity, and as a result take back control of our thoughts and emotions.

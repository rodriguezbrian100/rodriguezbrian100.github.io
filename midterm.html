      I decided to create my global issues paper on the topic of social media because, while it is definitely a first world problem, and there are many people that do not have the privilege of accessing the internet, I believe the negative impacts that social media has on the mental health of the millions of people that do use it is still severe enough to be considered a global epidemic.
      <br></br>
      The internet is humanity's fastest form of communication, and in today's modern world, we are constantly using social media sites to connect with friends, family, etc. While it has never been easier to keep in contact with people in the age of social media, there have also been rising concerns of social media exacerbating feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and low self esteem. This has been proven throughout all ages of users, but it has had an especially severe impact on youth whose minds are still developing and, as a result, are prone to developing depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and other mental health concerns.
      <br></br>
      This issue hits close to home with me because I've experienced first-hand the harmful effects social media can have on your mental health, which is why I've recently decided delete my social media apps and "unplug" for an indefinite amount of time. I think it's important for young people who are struggling with mental health to distance themselves from social media, because whether we realize it or not, every single piece of content we absorb on a daily basis through these social media sites are influencing us and the way we view ourselves, making us feel like we're lacking in some way, and only worsening feelings of inadequacy and low self esteem.
      <br></br>
      In this poster, I hope to communicate that by unplugging from social media, we can stop it from subconsciously feeding us negativity, and as a result take back control of our thoughts and emotions. Much like an intravenous injection, by mindlessly scrolling through our social media timelines daily, we are unknowingly absorbing tons of information into our subconscious. Only by recognizing and understanding this can we decide whether social media is helping or hurting us in the long run.
